# GPS-6.0
    Computational prediction of phosphorylation sites (p-sites) with their cognate protein kinases (PKs) is greatly helpful for further experimental design. Previously, our group developed and maintained a series of PK-specific p-site predictors. Since its release, GPS series have been widely used and prompted many biological discoveries. Recently, we collected 490,762 non-redundant known p-sites as the benchmark data set, which is at least ten fold against other existing tools, combined 10 types of informative features, and implemented a hybrid-learning architecture by integrating deep-learning and conventional machine-learning algorithms into a single framework. Then we updated the tool of GPS 6.0 with 651 individual predictors for predicting p-sites of 500 human PKs constructed by fine-tuning. To demonstrate the performance of GPS 6.0, we compared with other existing tools by using a timestamp-based dataset, which showed significant improvement of AUC. The server uses sequences or protein ids as input, and its output shows the predicted phosphorylation sites with sequence annotations maps, 3D structures, source, kinase-substrate-interaction links and other annotations & visualizations. To extend the application of GPS 6.0, a species-specific module was implemented to predict kinase-specific p-sites for 45,943 PKs in 169 eukaryotes.
